# XOR Attacks
- This tool contains the most common two types of attack [Known-Plaintext Attack , Many Time Pad Attack]
- The First Attack `Known-Plaintext Attack` takes an (ecrypted File , base64 string , hex string ) and a part of Plaintext and reverse xors it with a password specified by the user. This well then produce the plaintext data
- if we say your Plaintext is `Flag{W3lc0me_T0_X0R}` you should put a part from Plaintext Like `Flag{` 
- The Secound Attack `Many Time Pad Attack` Takes  (ecrypted Files or base64 strings or hex strings and Target Cipher) and get The Comman Key Between Them Then Get The PlainText of Target Cipher
